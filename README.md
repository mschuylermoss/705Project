# 705Project
Code for the final project of PHYS 705 at the University of Waterloo.

Monte Carlo Simulations and accompanying calcuations for the 2D Ising model and the 2D XY model on a square lattice.

NOTE: Although there is a folder titled "Graham" I did not end up using data obtained from running those scripts on the cluster. After implementing the Wolff cluster update, I was able to obtain all of the data presented in my report with just my laptop.
